# Print Academic Posters on Foldable Fabric

I've been printing and presenting fabric academic posters with [Spoonflower](https://www.spoonflower.com) for a few years, and I really like it!
These fabrics are foldable, making it easy to travel with them (simply throw them in my backpack) without the hassle of carrying a poster tube.
The quality of the fabric is excellent, with high resolution and reusability.
For example, I have used one poster for more than three events. ðŸ˜„

Below is a picture of the [WebSHAP](https://poloclub.github.io/webshap) poster first presented at [The Web Conference 2023](https://archives.iw3c2.org/www2023/). This note shows the simple steps to print these posters from [Spoonflower](https://www.spoonflower.com).

## Step 1: Export Your Poster to a JPEG

1. Export your poster from your design software (e.g., PowerPoint, Affinity Designer) to a single JPEG file.
2. Refer to [this guide](https://support.spoonflower.com/hc/en-us/articles/204266984-Tutorial-Creating-a-Fabric-Presentation-Poster-from-a-PDF#adobe) for instructions on exporting JPEG from PowerPoint, Google Slides, and Photoshop.
3. Export the JPEG with 150 DPI (dots per inch).
   1. I always print my poster using A0 size (vertical or horizontal), which has a size of 33.1 x 46.8 inches. Therefore, I just set the poster to be 4965 x 7020 pixels in the design software ($33.1 \times 150 = 4965$).
4. Export your poster with the s-RGB color profile. It is usually the default option.

### Best practices

1. Use high-contrast colors in your poster, especially when using dark colors on top of each other (e.g., gray on black).
2. Be careful with highly saturated dark colors (e.g., dark bright blue), as they may appear differently on the fabric.
3. If you use a light background in the poster, make sure it is true white (#FFFFFF) or totally transparent. Spoonflower will exclude these areas instead of printing them with white ink.

## Step 2: Upload the JPEG to Spoonflower

You can upload your poster JEPG to [Spoonflower](https://www.spoonflower.com) by selecting `My profile` â†’ `Design library` â†’ `Add Design`.

Then, you can configure your poster using the settings below.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/x723IZe.png" width="100%"></td>

  </tr>
  <tr></tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KIUTkIL.png" width="100%"></a></td>
    </tr>
</table>

1. If your poster is vertical, rotate it left/right 90Â° **before** uploading
2. Click `Edit` in the Fabric card under "Edit Scale & Repeat"
3. Choose **56''** for Preview Fabric
4. Choose **Center** for Repeat
5. Make sure you can see your whole poster in the left preview. Your printed poster will look exactly like this including the white paddings.
6. Save the configuration

## Step 3: Order Your Poster

Once you have configured the layout of your poster, you can click `Buy` in the Fabric card to order your poster.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UN5sC2p.png" width="100%"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

1. Choose **Sport PiquÃ©** for Fabric
2. Choose **Yard 56'' x 36''** for Size
3. Click **Add to Cart** to continue the ordering process

## Step 4: Present Your Poster

1. To travel with your poster, simply fold it and put it in your backpack. There will be almost no creases after unfolding.
2. If your poster is A0 size, there will be white padding around it. You can use a scissor to cut it out (see the [WebSHAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09545) poster) or use clips to fold it backward (see the [NOVA](https://github.com/poloclub/nova) poster). I recommend directly cutting it out directly.
3. Use plenty of pins to hang your poster to prevent it from becoming saggy (especially for horizontal posters).
